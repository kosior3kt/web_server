# what is it?
this is my interpretation of how a very stupid and simple http server may work. I've never check how it actually does work, so it's
no wonder it's prolly slow and stupid.

## building:
it expects to have a directory called 'std_lib' in root directory. std_lib is my another repo (standard_libarary) or sth like that.
One day I will make it this odd github link, but this day is not yet.
There is also build script provided, so you know...

## future:
In the future I will make it modular - for now if you want to have any logic you just hardcode it in there - that's not cool.

## future2:
Before starting some other feature I will make a template generator
